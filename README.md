This project uses a database from a virtual company named Northwind (Database is integrated to the project with Database First) 
A cart system is simulated where the user can add and remove products to their cart. 
Singleton pattern is used to ensure database is only instanced once. 
FYI, payment view is to be integrated in a future date, so that view does not work yet.
